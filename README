Spell file for multi accented (also known as polytonic) Greek. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This spell file is for checking the spelling of texts typed in multi 
accented (or polytonic) Greek. It is useful to Greek scholars 
(hellenists) as well as native Greek speakers who prefer to write 
in the traditional multi accented script.  

The word list covers all the ancient and modern Greek vocabulary.
About 1.5 million words all spelled in the traditional polytonic system. 

The ancient Greek word list is derived from several corpora like 
Perseus [2], and TLG [3] and other sources.

The modern Greek word list is derived from the ispell dictionary el_GR [1]
but all the words have been appropriately accentuated. This spell file
flags monotonic spelling as errors.

The two lists are combined, cleaned of double entries (there was a large 
ovelap) and sorted. Last syllable varia (grave accent)  and double oxias 
(as when shifted from the following word) have been replaced by SFX 
rules in the affix file.

It works quite well with Vim and it is fast, but bear in mind that it is far
from finished. (see bugs below).

Known bugs
--------------

Hyphenated words are not recognised and are flagged as spelling errors.

It does not distinguish between medial and final sigma. Suggestions only
display medial sigma and :spelldump shows all final sigmas as medial ones.
A final sigma in the middle of a word passes as correct.

Words written in capital letters, even when are spelled correctly (without accents), are 
flagged as errors.

If anyone wishes to help, e-mail me and I will forward the .dic and .aff files.
